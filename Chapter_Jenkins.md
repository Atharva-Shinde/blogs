Above is a raw traditional process on how development cycle works. Consider your team working on a new functionality for an application and you want to deploy it to the upcoming release version. Initially you will push your code to a version control system like Github, BitBucket or your company's private version control system. All the manual work ends here. The problem here is the build process takes a considerable amount of time, in fact development teams had a custom nightly build convention where all the build process were scheduled at night, but 'nightly' build was relative because of different time-zones. For example if a company decides for night build of 12:30AM EST, the build would be 10:30AM IST, 4:00PM AEST and therefore all developers had to commit their code for build at their respective timezones which affected their productivity.

#### Alternative to Jenkins
